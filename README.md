# Firebase Laundry Reservation System
This repository contains the source code for a web-based laundry reservation system that utilizes Firebase for real-time data storage.
Users can reserve laundry machines, check machine availability, and view their reservations.
The system also supports removing reservations and marking them as picked up.

## Usage
The application provides a user interface for reserving laundry machines, checking machine status, and managing reservations. Users can interact with the system through the provided HTML elements.

## Reservation Process
Fill in the required information (machine type, start time, end time, name, dorm room, and optional note) in the reservation form.
Click the "Reserve" button to attempt a reservation.
If the reservation is successful, a success message is displayed. Otherwise, an error message indicates the reason for failure.
Managing Reservations
Users can remove their reservations by clicking the "Remove Reservation" button in the reservation list.
Reservations marked as past (completed) have an additional "Pick Up" button to signify that the laundry is ready for pickup.
Machine Status
The system periodically checks and displays the current status of each machine, indicating whether it is occupied or available.

## Customization
Feel free to customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to fit your specific requirements. You can modify the UI, add additional features, or integrate the system into an existing web application.
